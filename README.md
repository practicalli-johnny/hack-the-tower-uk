hack-the-tower-uk (deprecated)
=================

Website for hack the tower bi-monthly hack day

I am abandoining this version of the website and going to recreate a new version from scratch using Twitter bootstrap.  The new site will be deployed on Github pages as it will be a static website (i.e no reliance on database or local services).

If you are interested, take a look at the [new repo I have created for the Twitter Bootstrap version of the site]([https://github.com/jr0cket/hackthetower-bootstrap](https://github.com/practicalli-johnny/hackthetower)).

Thank you
Johnny Stevenson
